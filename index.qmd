# Overview

ReSight is positioning itself to become the authoritative source of truth and insights for the U.S. pet industry. This transformation requires a robust, scalable ETL infrastructure capable of processing comprehensive industry data at scale.

## Current State Analysis (2024)

Our current ETL infrastructure demonstrates significant daily processing capacity with notable variability in workload:

### Daily Processing Statistics

| Metric            | Typical Day (Median) | Peak Day | Average (Mean) |
| :---------------- | :------------------- | :------- | :------------- |
| Loads Processed   | 40                   | 303      | 59.2           |
| Rows Processed    | 70,588               | 824,719  | 105,218        |
| Processing Window | Flexible             | Flexible | Flexible       |

### Load Distribution Analysis

- **Daily Load Range**: 1-303 loads per day
- **Typical Range (Q1-Q3)**: 24-65 loads per day
- **Standard Deviation**: 54.8 loads, indicating high variability
- **Processing Reliability**: 361 days of consistent operation with no outages

### Data Volume Patterns

- **Daily Row Range**: 28-824,719 rows
- **Typical Range (Q1-Q3)**: 15,606-159,225 rows
- **Volume Variability**: Standard deviation of 115,282 rows
- **Processing Success Rate**: 100% (no missing days)

## Target State (2026)

| Metric            | Value                                   | Growth Factor        |
| :---------------- | :-------------------------------------- | :------------------- |
| Daily Loads       | 400+/day                                | 10x current median   |
| Data Volume       | 700K+ rows/day typical                  | 10x current median   |
| Data Sources      | 1000+ integrated sources                | 10x current scale    |
| Complexity        | High (ML pipelines)                     | Significant increase |
| Processing Window | Near real-time requirements (if needed) | Minutes vs. flexible |

## Growth Requirements

Our next-generation ETL pipeline must support:

1. **Scalable Data Integration**

   - Handle 10x increase in daily load frequency
   - Process 10x current data volumes
   - Support 10x growth in data source connections

2. **Advanced Processing Capabilities**

   - Predictive analytics pipelines
   - Machine learning model integration
   - Market insight generation

3. **Enterprise-Scale Operations**
   - Consistent high-volume processing
   - 24/7 operation with high availability
   - Industry-leading security controls

# Infrastructure Strategy

## Core Requirements

## Key Performance Indicators

| Metric               | Current (2024) | Target (2026) |
| :------------------- | :------------- | :------------ |
| Daily Loads (Median) | 40             | 400+          |
| Peak Daily Loads     | 303            | 3000+         |
| Daily Rows (Median)  | 70,588         | 700K+         |
| Peak Daily Rows      | 824,719        | 8M+           |
| Processing Latency   | Hours          | Minutes       |
| Data Sources         | ~100           | 1000+         |
