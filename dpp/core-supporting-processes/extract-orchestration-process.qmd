# Extract Orchestration Process

## Overview

The Extract Orchestration Process defines how our system coordinates and manages the various activities required to extract data from distributor ERP systems. This process is a critical supporting component that enables both API-based and database-based extraction workflows.

## Process Responsibilities

The Extract Orchestration Process is responsible for:

- Coordinating the end-to-end extraction sequence
- Managing transitions between extraction phases
- Delegating specialized tasks to appropriate components
- Handling error conditions and recovery procedures
- Monitoring extraction progress and performance
- Ensuring data lineage and traceability

## Key Orchestration Phases

### Initialization Phase

The orchestration process begins by establishing the extraction context:

- Creating a unique identifier for the extraction operation
- Recording start time and requested parameters
- Initializing monitoring and metrics collection
- Establishing extraction boundaries and scope

### Preparation Phase

Before data extraction begins, the process:

- Obtains and validates the appropriate configuration
- Retrieves necessary security credentials
- Determines extraction mode (full or incremental)
- Prepares extraction parameters based on data type
- Allocates resources needed for extraction

### Execution Phase

During the execution phase, the process:

- Delegates to the appropriate extraction mechanism (API or database)
- Monitors progress and handles pagination
- Collects and assembles extracted data
- Manages resource utilization during extraction
- Applies resilience patterns for reliability

### Processing Phase

Once data is extracted, the process:

- Coordinates data transformation to standard format
- Ensures data validation against quality rules
- Manages the conversion to efficient storage format
- Handles the storage of processed data
- Records data lineage and provenance information

### Completion Phase

The final phase includes:

- Finalizing extraction metrics and statistics
- Reporting on extraction outcomes
- Releasing allocated resources
- Logging completion status and results
- Triggering any necessary follow-up actions

## Error Handling Strategy

The Extract Orchestration Process implements a comprehensive error handling strategy:

### Connection Issues
- Retries with exponential backoff for transient failures
- Circuit breaking for persistent failures
- Detailed logging of connection problems
- Graceful shutdown for unrecoverable errors

### Data Quality Issues
- Classification of quality issues by severity
- Tracking of quality metrics for reporting
- Continuation despite non-critical issues
- Configurable quality thresholds

### Resource Limitations
- Monitoring of memory and connection usage
- Backpressure mechanisms for large datasets
- Resource cleanup during errors
- Checkpointing for resumable operations

## Decision Points

The Extract Orchestration Process makes several key decisions during execution:

### Extraction Mode Selection
- Full extraction when no previous extraction exists
- Incremental extraction when possible for efficiency
- Force full extraction when data integrity concerns exist

### Quality Threshold Enforcement
- Proceed despite minor quality issues
- Halt for critical data integrity problems
- Record all quality concerns for later analysis

### Resource Allocation
- Adjust batch sizes based on data volume
- Manage connection pool for optimal throughput
- Balance memory usage with processing speed

## Monitoring and Control

Throughout the extraction process, several monitoring mechanisms provide visibility and control:

### Real-time Metrics
- Extraction progress percentage
- Records processed per second
- Resource utilization statistics
- Error and warning counts

### Control Points
- Ability to pause extraction if needed
- Emergency shutdown for problematic extractions
- Priority adjustment for concurrent extractions

## Integration with Workflows

The Extract Orchestration Process serves as the core supporting process for:

- **API Extraction Workflow**: Handling the coordination of API-based extractions
- **Database Extraction Workflow**: Managing the flow of database extraction operations

By centralizing orchestration logic, we ensure consistent behavior, error handling, and monitoring across different extraction methods.

## Design Principles

The Extract Orchestration Process follows several key design principles:

### Separation of Concerns
- Orchestration logic separated from extraction mechanisms
- Clear boundaries between orchestration and business rules
- Distinct responsibilities for each phase of the process

### Resilience by Design
- Graceful handling of failures
- Recovery mechanisms for common error scenarios
- Isolation of failures to prevent cascading issues

### Transparency
- Complete visibility into extraction status
- Detailed logging of decision points
- Comprehensive metrics collection

### Adaptability
- Support for different extraction methods
- Extensibility for new ERP systems
- Configurability for different extraction requirements
