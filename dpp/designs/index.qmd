# Services Overview

This document outlines all the services required for our Distributor Data Extraction System, following the IDesign architecture pattern. Each service has a specific responsibility and interacts with other services according to the defined communication rules.

## Service Dependency Graph



## Manager Layer

### ExtractionManager

**Responsibility**: Orchestrates the complete data extraction workflow, from initiation to completion.

**Key Functions**:

- Coordinates the extraction process for both API and database sources
- Delegates specialized tasks to appropriate engines
- Manages the overall extraction state and progress
- Handles error scenarios and provides recovery mechanisms
- Ensures proper security context throughout the process

## Engines Layer

### ConfigurationEngine

**Responsibility**: Implements business logic for managing extraction configuration.

**Key Functions**:

- Determines which configuration parameters are needed for specific ERP types
- Processes raw configuration data into usable extraction settings
- Applies default values where needed
- Validates configuration completeness and correctness
- Manages configuration versioning and compatibility

### ExtractorEngine

**Responsibility**: Implements business logic for extracting data from various sources.

**Key Functions**:

- Contains algorithms for different extraction methods
- Implements ERP-specific extraction strategies
- Manages data retrieval processes including pagination
- Handles extraction-specific error scenarios
- Optimizes extraction performance based on data characteristics

### TransformerEngine

**Responsibility**: Implements business logic for transforming extracted data to standard formats.

**Key Functions**:

- Applies field mapping rules for standardization
- Converts data types to consistent formats
- Implements calculation rules for derived fields
- Manages data cleansing operations
- Handles special transformation cases by data type

### ValidationEngine

**Responsibility**: Implements business logic for validating data quality.

**Key Functions**:

- Applies schema validation rules
- Implements business rule validations

- Categorizes validation issues by severity
- Produces detailed validation reports

### LineageEngine

**Responsibility**: Implements business logic for tracking data provenance.

**Key Functions**:

- Determines what metadata should be captured during extraction
- Implements rules for lineage record structure
- Processes lineage information for reporting
- Manages the relationship between extractions and data assets
- Provides data history and traceability

## Accessors Layer

### VaultAccessor

**Responsibility**: Provides secure access to credentials and secrets.

**Key Functions**:
