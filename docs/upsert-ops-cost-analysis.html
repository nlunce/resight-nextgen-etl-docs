<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>This report compares the costs and trade-offs between AWS Glue and Amazon EMR for performing upsert operations. An upsert (update-insert) operation updates existing records if they exist or inserts new records if they donâ€™t, commonly used in data warehousing and ETL processes. We analyze historical usage patterns to project annual costs and evaluate the management overhead of each service. The analysis includes instance type recommendations, pricing models, and technical specifications to help you make an informed decision for your use case.</p>
