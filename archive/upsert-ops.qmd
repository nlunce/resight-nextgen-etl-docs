# Summary

This document compares two AWS-based Apache Spark solutions for handling UPSERT operations from S3 to multiple target databases including MSSQL and Apache Iceberg:

1. AWS Glue: A managed Apache Spark service
2. Apache Spark on Amazon EMR: A more configurable Spark deployment

:::{.callout-note}
Both solutions use Apache Spark as their processing engine. The key differences lie in management, configuration, and operational aspects rather than core processing capabilities.

# Understanding the Options

## AWS Glue {.unnumbered}

AWS Glue provides a managed Apache Spark environment with:

- Built-in Apache Spark engine (same as EMR)
- AWS-specific optimizations and tooling
- Both Spark SQL and PySpark interfaces
- Additional features like DynamicFrames
- Managed infrastructure and scaling

## Spark on EMR {.unnumbered}

Amazon EMR provides a more traditional Spark deployment with:

- Full Apache Spark ecosystem
- Complete configuration control
- Custom cluster management
- Direct access to Spark internals
- Infrastructure flexibility

# Cost Analysis

## AWS Glue Costs

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Pricing Structure

- $0.44 per DPU-Hour (1 DPU = 4 vCPU, 16GB memory)
- Minimum 10-minute billing
- Development endpoints additional cost

### Hidden Savings

- No cluster management costs
- Includes Spark optimization
- Less operational overhead

### Considerations

- More expensive per compute hour
- Less granular scaling
- Simplified cost model

:::

## EMR Costs

:::{.panel-tabset}

### Direct Costs

- EC2 instance costs
- EMR service charges
- Storage and data transfer

### Optimization Options

- Spot instance usage
- More granular scaling
- Resource optimization

### Hidden Costs

- Operational overhead
- Management complexity
- Required expertise

# Performance Comparison

## AWS Glue Performance

```{.python}
# Example Glue Spark UPSERT implementation
from awsglue.context import GlueContext
from pyspark.context import SparkContext

# Initialize Glue Spark context
glueContext = GlueContext(SparkContext.getOrCreate())
spark = glueContext.spark_session

# Read from S3 (using standard Spark)
source_df = spark.read.parquet("s3://bucket/path")

# MSSQL UPSERT
def perform_mssql_upsert(df):
    # Write to staging table using Spark JDBC
    df.write \
        .format("jdbc") \
        .option("url", jdbc_url) \
        .option("dbtable", "staging_table") \
        .mode("overwrite") \
        .save()

    # Execute MERGE using Spark SQL
    spark.sql("""
    MERGE INTO target_table t
    USING staging_table s
    ON t.key = s.key
    WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE...
    WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT...
    """)
```

## Glue Performance Strengths

- Pre-configured Spark optimizations
- AWS service-specific tuning
- Auto-scaling built in
- Warm pools reduce startup time

:::

:::{.callout-warning}

## Glue Performance Limitations

- Less Spark configuration flexibility
- Fixed worker configurations
- Limited Spark version control

:::

## EMR Performance

```{.python}
# Example EMR Spark UPSERT implementation
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

# Initialize Spark session
spark = SparkSession.builder \
    .appName("EMR UPSERT") \
    .getOrCreate()

# Read from S3 (identical to Glue)
source_df = spark.read.parquet("s3://bucket/path")

# MSSQL UPSERT (identical to Glue)
def perform_mssql_upsert(df):
    df.write \
        .format("jdbc") \
        .option("url", jdbc_url) \
        .option("dbtable", "staging_table") \
        .mode("overwrite") \
        .save()
```

# Recommendation

## Short Term

Recommend starting with AWS Glue due to:

- Faster implementation
- Managed environment
- Sufficient for current scale
- Lower operational overhead

## Long Term

Consider migration to EMR if:

- Approaching cost crossover point
- Requiring more performance optimization
- Team has built Spark expertise
- Need more control over infrastructure

# Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Initial Setup

1. Set up development environment
2. Create test jobs
3. Establish monitoring
4. Document procedures

## Phase 2: Production Migration

1. Migrate simple jobs
2. Add error handling
3. Implement monitoring
4. Document operations

## Phase 3: Optimization

1. Performance tuning
2. Cost optimization
3. Process refinement
4. Team training
